1,October 2023,triciaburda,,"Went to Vegas for Halloween
Went to Vegas for Halloween and got married. It was one of my favorite vacations. The view was amazing, we got to watch the sunrise everyday. The employees at the steakhouse were amazing. We had our dinner there after our wedding. I can’t wait to come back.

2,August 2022,Ron K,,"MGM Grand is the best Hotel on the strip IMHO
MGM is very clean hotel with very friendly staff, the best restaurants, great shows, lots of slot machines, great walking location to New York New York, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. My wife and I love the easy walk and experience through the shops and casinos to all the aforementioned hotels. It is also a stop on the Monorail route, which is a good way to visit other casinos on the strip. We've stayed at other hotels but MGM Grand is now the only place we stay when visiting Las Vegas.

3,October 2023,jeremya842023,,"Dirty rooms
The room had empty nut shells on the floor and the bathtub was full of hair and scum. I let it go the first night and politely informed housekeeping the next day instead of calling the desk and getting someone in trouble. Then after returning to my room after cleaning services the second day the bathtub was still disgusting and there were still empty nut shells on the floor. Also the entire resort smells heavily of cigarette smoke and/or perfume to try and cover the smell. I have stayed in other resorts in Las Vegas as I am there every year at this time and this stay was by far the worst that I have ever had.

4,November 2023,alY4645OQ,,"Terrible air quality, small fees everywhere
In room water - $25 per bottle.
ATM withdrawal fee - $9.99
Resort fee - $33
Air quality--crap.
Just charging for everything, on top of $300 a night (special business rate). Everything is old in terms of infrastructure.

"
5,October 2023,jmcqueen990,,"Decent property just not during business week
No desk in room to check emails. Internet horrible. Fine for a family stay in Vegas, just not for me to have my company there during the week for a convention like SEMA. The food and restaurants were nice.

"
6,November 2023,Asamo B,,"Do Not Stay Here
the staff was very awesome but to charge money and put a guest in room 22nd floor 222 is a criminal charge no fridge no microwave no coffee no pool no gym after 6 is stupid the tv is horrible and don't work the hotel makes too much money to not afford upkeep on tv the furniture is as old as the mob movies filmed out here so sad they need to be shut down and re opened after a huge update and renovation.

"
7,October 2023,Csinh301,,"5 star
Rooms are clean, toilet paper kinda thin, room temps ok, view ok, good place to sleep. Thumbs up.Table minimums were too high. Windows green. Tiesto gone. Sad. Sema convention inflation. Not a fan. Monorail super busy.

"
8,November 2023,marktB2974UB,,"MGM Room fail
Room was a huge let down..dirty carpet, aged and old wallpaper and furniture. 3 chairs, 2 dirty and 1 torn up and ripped. The shower curtail was ripped up. Ther is no fridge to use, no microwave(that's OK, but no fridge??? Really??) Just a poor experience. When you go on a trip, you look forward to resting in some luxurys..this had me feeling like I was in a motel.

"
9,October 2023,aroach815,,"MGM GRAND SERVICE/STAFF TOP NOTCH
Front desk clerk and housekeeping staff always courteous and goes beyond with great customer service! MGM has a monorail station which makes it so convenient to explore the strip! I wish there were more non-smoking areas for the casino floor.

"
10,November 2023,mikeO751YQ,,"It was OK
Place was great, the room was not. TV worked part time and we were put in the worst room in the place. When I come to Vegas I spend a lot on gambling and expect a great room. I’ll be back but next time will insist on better room

"
11,October 2023,andyC2624ZE,,"Just Fair
The hotel felt old, smoke eaters in the casino were not effective - By the time I walked from desk to my room - my clothes smelled of smoke. Bathroom sink was not attached and bounced around when you used it. I have traveled all my business career - experience was just blaw - and if I can't put anything in the fridge of my own leftovers from your restaurants without a charge - just not good at all. I did like you were on the monorail. .

"
12,November 2023,mannyc1172023,,"Average stay at best
We came on a package to see the usher concert. It was a two day stay so we werent in the room for long periods of time. Room was dirty and smelled like smoke. The fridge was packed with overpriced useless items that i ended up being charged for because they shifted from their sensors

"
13,November 2023,jeffhansen10,,"If you need internet, consider an alternative
The property is what you would expect from a casino unless you have a need for an internet connection. If it important to you or your stay, consider an alternative to this location. If that’s not possible, make sure to confirm your room has reliable connection. The TV wouldn’t even play without buffering. 90’s dial up was faster (when you could actually connect)

"
14,November 2023,DruWright666,,"Just Okay
My recent stay at the MGM Grand left me with a mix of impressions. The hotel's location, while not exceptional, was decent, and the staff demonstrated friendliness and a willingness to accommodate guests, leaving an overall satisfactory impression. However, my experience was marred by several disappointments related to the room.

The most significant issue was the room's darkness. Despite multiple light fixtures, the lighting was consistently dim, making it challenging to comfortably use the room. This deficiency was particularly frustrating during the day when proper lighting should be a given.

The bed was another letdown. Its discomfort impacted the quality of my sleep significantly. The mattress appeared well-worn,
and with only a thin blanket and sheet, I often felt cold during the night. The pillows, too, were subpar, offering minimal support and resulting in waking up with a sore back each morning.

On a more positive note, the room was consistently clean, and the amenities provided were satisfactory. The bathroom was well-maintained, and the housekeeping staff delivered their services efficiently.

While the MGM possessed certain merits, the persistent issues with the room's darkness and the uncomfortable bed overshadowed the positive aspects of my stay. I sincerely hope that the hotel takes measures to address these concerns in the future to enhance the comfort and quality of their rooms.

15,October 2023,Tour813888,,"Excellent Hotel, Convenient Location
I was there for a convention. Rooms were clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. Nice having the monorail right there too. Plenty of dining options and certainly plenty to do. The hotel is kept immaculate and looks like new.

"
16,October 2023,treyeliteauto,,"Our stay
Rooms were over priced for the condition. Furniture was old & beat up. Master bathroom shower the handle was broke and kept falling off. The water temperature was either ice cold or scorching hot. The casino was nice but other casinos have a lot more to offer.

"
17,November 2023,ANuminousOne,,"Issues aplenty, poor response from most staff. Find somewhere else to stay on the strip.
Where to start? I originally had a reservation in another property and cancelled to stay at the MGM Grand specifically because of its pools and lazy river. Bad move on my part.

1) No hot water first day of our stay. Cold shower isn’t a great start.
2) Changed plans and instead of going to Zion, we opted to stay near the hotel specifically to go to pools and lazy river (reason we chose MGM). Found all but 1 pool closed. No notification when we booked. Major disappointment for the kids. As an aside, I e never seen a Vegas pool with less vibe. 77° out, perfect pool weather, tons of people out crowded around the one pool. No music. No beverage service. No vibe at all.
3) Went back to room to clean up before we made new plans. Now hot water wasn’t a problem because this time we had no water at all. Was told that I should have been notified about a water shutoff. Wasn’t notified about that either.
4) Woken up at 2:30AM by a loud noise (sounded like a water pipe pressure issue to me), called front desk and was told another guest had complained about a “drilling sound” and they would send security to investigate. Noise finally stopped at 3:03AM.
5) Noise returned around 3:30AM and continued after I mercifully fell asleep around 4AM.
6) Spoke with a really nice person at the front desk on checkout. All that was offered though was to remove the $39 “resort fee”, kind but IMO hardly representative of all the issues we had.

While not the end of the world, this was by far one of the worst hotel stays I’ve ever had. Issues happen, I get it. But when there are many other options for hotels, response and service is key. Vegas is all about catering to the guest. It’s was the response of most of the hotel staff (or lack thereof) that was so disappointing. I am going to try to reach out to management on Monday to give them the chance to make this right, but there are lots of other non-MGM properties in the strip. As of now, I’ll be searching out other options.

"
18,November 2023,Cruiser376758840199,,"Double charged resort fees, staff was not friendly or helpful
Double charged resort fees, staff was not friendly or helpful. I would consider hidden fees when planning to book at MGM over another hotel. At this point I do not think I will stay at another MGM hotel and I would be happy to give my business to another company that provides a better experience even if it comes at a higher price.

"
19,October 2023,l0rdphilc,,"Always a great place to stay
I have stayed at this property 15+ times, usually for 4-6 days.

The property never disappoints. Great nightlife, good food, friendly, atmosphere, and great location.

I always stay at MGM properties in Las Vegas, MGM. Grand has been one of my staples.

"
20,October 2023,Greg P,,"Broken and dated.
Room had a number of issues that weren’t resolved. Room was dark, window shade broken. Water shut off or no cold water at times all the days of our stay. No advance notice. No notice at checkin that this was scheduled.

"
21,October 2023,r8rbrat72,,"Good trip
We had never stayed here and it was just what we needed. I was bummed we didn’t make it to the pool. Lazy river would have been fun. Next time. Great choices for food and plus Starbucks. 3 of them that we saw!

"
22,November 2023,thatboyck,,"Dated and Small Rooms
The room was dated, small, not very clean and in a terrible location. We heard everyone walking down the hall all night and the buzzing sound of the AC unit kept us up as well. This place needs a major make over.

"
23,October 2023,madrdh,,"Just OK
Like location. Pool was in Winter mode. So only 2 pools open. That made pools crowded. Never got a drink while gambling. Bathtub drain was clogged, notified front desk 3x. Was never fixed. Tap restaurant was good.

"
24,October 2023,890jerry,,"Front Desk no Help
I was clearly in app. booked through the 30th. Front desk says was booked to 29th. Showed them 20 times app and reservation says thru 30th. They charged me another night, although I was clearly booked and paid through the 30th and said there is nothing they can do about it. MGM reservations is a different entity from MGM front desk.

Expalin that BS

"
25,November 2023,Aaron,,"Avoid if you like running water
On our last night of a four night stay in one of the upgraded king spa suites.

Three of four nights we didn’t have hot water. Two mornings we had no water in the room at all. Being hungover and unable to shower when you’re paying $300 a night for a room is a insane. Not sure it’s even legal to rent rooms without running water. Some third world sh*t.

Maid service came ONLY ONCE in our four days. She did a half ass job and left a wet towel on our bed. How charming.

Overall an underwhelming experience, to say the least. Will not being staying again.

"
26,October 2023,RKPeterson,,"Rewards trip for Old Dominion concert
We had a great time! The Old Dominion concert was fantastic! Super nice host there helped give us better seats than we were randomly assigned. That is a special band for us, so it was greatly appreciated!

"
27,November 2023,Todd B,,"Horrible in many aspects.
A rare review from me but wow…this place is bad. Really bad. It starts with the room. Trash outside the door from my 7pm check in and still there in the AM. Not cleaned well with long hair strands clearly visible. Then it has a shower curtain (not a complaint but shows how long since the room has been updated). Gym doesn’t open until 7am nor does the only sit down breakfast option which then has a line out the door at 7:01. TV wasn’t working and I asked the front desk to send someone. Never happened during my 3 night stay. And finally a cold shower my last morning. Never again.

"
28,October 2023,michaelafreed,,"A classic property but showing signs of age
This is a huge property. I was in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and was actually able to spend 2 entire days without leaving the property due to all the services available onsite there. Some areas are showing signs of age and I feel like the casino is kind of dark and maybe a bit dingy compared to more modern properties that are all brightly colored and lit.

"
29,October 2023,ckeller823,,"Would Recommend
Overall stay was very nice. Rooms were clean and check-in/out was super easy on the app. Plenty of dining options and good location on strip. I would stay again in the future and recommend staying here.

"
30,October 2023,Trail12481951069,,"Great staff though, but the rooms were not great for that price tag at all.
The staff was ultra hepful and deserves a 5 star. The disability room we were in had a terrible odor. In both rooms that we stayed, you could see that wear and tear is setting in. It's too massive for people with mobility issues.

"
31,October 2023,r0bbiev13,,"Stay well scam
The stay well room was a scam. Rooms were dated smelled like cigarettes and rust. Bed was hard as a rock, the “in room purifier” was nothing more than a fan.
I won’t stay at any hotel on the strip going forward regardless of price

"
32,November 2023,living_the_dream12,,"Pleasantly surprised
I have been to Vegas too many times to count, but this was the first time to MGM Grand. I heard some reviews making it sound concerning in comparison to our usual favorites but it was actually pleasantly surprising.

The negatives:
- wifi was never working in our room
-only one electrical outlet in the entire room worked even after trying to reset them so to charge any electronics you had to rotate through plugging them in.
-The phone was covered in a thick layer of dust and we dropped something on the ground and looked under the nightstand to look for it and found someone’s old liquor bottle under there. But overall clean except for those two things as I did see some poor reviews on the cleaning.

Overall the hotel was clean and a fun crowd. The lazy river at the pool was lots of fun. Lots of restaurants to choose from, but not as high end customer service in the resort overall as some of the other higher end hotels.

"
33,October 2023,MMD-on-the-go,,"Always Completely Satisfied With MGM Grand
This was the third time we stayed at MGM Grand. Great rooms, restaurants and pools. Nice size casino, great location. Convenient access to the tram. Staff is friendly and eager to please. Has become our favorite Vegas resort.

"
34,October 2023,aztecblue2,,"Great stay
Mgm is a great resort and provided all the services we needed. The room provided enough space for my family and was safe for everyone. The lazy river was great because my daughter enjoys going in the water. Great hotel.

"
35,October 2023,fdipace,,"Abysmal mattresses and dark outdated room
The hotel rooms are in desperate need of un update. The mattresses are horrible. The room itself was dark even with all the lights on and the furniture needs to be replaced. The staff always seem to act like they are doing you a favor. The shower head was one of the worst I've ever experienced at a hotel. As for service, we waited at the Whiskey bar for over 15 minutes without service even though there were 3 waitresses. We left and went to the 1923 bar which was fantastic. It is in the walkway between the Luxor and the Mandalay Bay. Also the Gold lounge doesn't even have coffee.

"
36,October 2023,Cheryl B,,"Clean hotel but if you get injured, plan on having to sign a waiver
The hotel itself is STUNNING AND CLEAN! The pool was heated and nice! Drinks are pricey but that’s anywhere in Vegas. My fiancé got injured on one of the slots where the foot board came loose and cut his leg. Security came and gave him a bandaid, and made him fill out an accident report, but they DIDNT FIX THE machine where it was broke, so it’s likely to happen to someone else who may get way more injured next time! They offered us 2 nights free to make it up next time we’re in Vegas. But limited the days we could come, told us we had to pay for our own air and parking, and that’s it! MGM… you can do better! Stop just catering to the high rollers and start caring about ALL of your guests! If you’re going to offer two free nights to make up for your error, do it right! Then they wanted him to sign a waiver to not talk about what happened, which we refused! That’s dirty!

"
37,October 2023,777jake123,,"Do not stay at MGM Grand
Charged $500 in room smoking penalty. Nobody in our family has ever smoked. Manager said everyone says that and refused to remove the charge. Hard to pay that much money when you are innocent. We were in Las Vegas for my 12 year olds baseball tournament with my 80 year old mother. Never been smokers or ever used drugs.

"
38,October 2023,kimmarshall117,,"Poor communication
They checked us into a dirty room and internet service was horrible. Only mini bar in room with expensive dinners should have refrigerator in rooms. Our saving grace was a very efficient house keeper that had our room ready within an hour

"
39,October 2023,Romtiger,,"MGM - not as famous
Way too expensive hotel for what it offers. They charge a room rate, a room rate tax and a daily resort fee of $ 40 and they charge a resort fee tax also, so, you pay $46 more of the advertised room rate every day you stay here. And you cannot avoid the resort fee.
One bottle of water on the top of the room refrigerator( we thought is complimentary, but was not) is $ 22. Yes, $ 22 for one bottle of water. The internet advertised to be hi speed, is just a joke , is slow and intermittent.
Friday night until 11:30 pm -12:00 am you can’t sleep or rest if you want. A crazy music from some club near to the hotel, ( or maybe from inside the hotel) makes your rest uncomfortable and annoying, especially if you have to get up early next morning to go to the airport.
So, all over, we were not satisfied with this resort . Is not friendly and does not care of clients satisfaction.
