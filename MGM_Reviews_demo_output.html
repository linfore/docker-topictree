My wife and I love the easy walk and experience through the shops and casinos to all the aforementioned hotels.

I let it go the first night and politely informed housekeeping the next day instead of calling the desk and getting someone in trouble. Then after returning to my room after cleaning services the second day the bathtub was still disgusting and there were still empty nut shells on the floor. Also the entire resort smells heavily of cigarette smoke and/or perfume to try and cover the smell.

The hotel's location, while not exceptional, was decent, and the staff demonstrated friendliness and a willingness to accommodate guests, leaving an overall satisfactory impression. However, my experience was marred by several disappointments related to the room.\n\nThe most significant issue was the room's darkness. Despite multiple light fixtures, the lighting was consistently dim, making it challenging to comfortably use the room. This deficiency was particularly frustrating during the day when proper lighting should be a given.\n\nThe bed was another letdown. Its discomfort impacted the quality of my sleep significantly. The mattress appeared well-worn,\nand with only a thin blanket and sheet, I often felt cold during the night. The pillows, too, were subpar, offering minimal support and resulting in waking up with a sore back each morning.\n\nOn a more positive note, the room was consistently clean, and the amenities provided were satisfactory. The bathroom was well-maintained, and the housekeeping staff delivered their services efficiently.\n\nWhile the MGM possessed certain merits, the persistent issues with the room's darkness and the uncomfortable bed overshadowed the positive aspects of my stay. I sincerely hope that the hotel takes measures to address these concerns in the future to enhance the comfort and quality of their rooms.\n\n"}, {15.0: 'date: October 2023 | user: Tour813888 | \n\nExcellent Hotel, Convenient Location\nI was there for a convention.

Find somewhere else to stay on the strip.\nWhere to start? I originally had a reservation in another property and cancelled to stay at the MGM Grand specifically because of its pools and lazy river. Bad move on my part.\n\n1) No hot water first day of our stay. Cold shower isn’t a great start.\n2) Changed plans and instead of going to Zion, we opted to stay near the hotel specifically to go to pools and lazy river (reason we chose MGM). Found all but 1 pool closed. No notification when we booked. Major disappointment for the kids. As an aside, I e never seen a Vegas pool with less vibe. 77° out, perfect pool weather, tons of people out crowded around the one pool. No music. No beverage service. No vibe at all.\n3) Went back to room to clean up before we made new plans. Now hot water wasn’t a problem because this time we had no water at all. Was told that I should have been notified about a water shutoff. Wasn’t notified about that either.\n4) Woken up at 2:30AM by a loud noise (sounded like a water pipe pressure issue to me), called front desk and was told another guest had complained about a “drilling sound” and they would send security to investigate. Noise finally stopped at 3:03AM.\n5) Noise returned around 3:30AM and continued after I mercifully fell asleep around 4AM.\n6) Spoke with a really nice person at the front desk on checkout. All that was offered though was to remove the $39 “resort fee”, kind but IMO hardly representative of all the issues we had.\n\nWhile not the end of the world, this was by far one of the worst hotel stays I’ve ever had. Issues happen, I get it. But when there are many other options for hotels, response and service is key. Vegas is all about catering to the guest. It’s was the response of most of the hotel staff (or lack thereof) that was so disappointing. I am going to try to reach out to management on Monday to give them the chance to make this right, but there are lots of other non-MGM properties in the strip. As of now, I’ll be searching out other options.\n\n'}, {18.0: 'date: November 2023 | user: Cruiser376758840199 | \n\nDouble charged resort fees, staff was not friendly or helpful\nDouble charged resort fees, staff was not friendly or helpful.

Stop just catering to the high rollers and start caring about ALL of your guests! If you’re going to offer two free nights to make up for your error, do it right!
